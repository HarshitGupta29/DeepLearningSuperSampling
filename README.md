A deep learning system that intelligently upscales low-resolution images to high-resolution (4K) with minimal artifacts using Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) enhanced with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) techniques for content-aware processing.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the fundamental challenge of image super-resolution: transforming low-resolution images into photorealistic high-resolution outputs without the typical pixelation and blurriness associated with traditional interpolation methods. Our approach combines:

- **SRGAN Architecture**: Generative adversarial training for perceptually realistic results
- **Content-Aware Processing**: Dual-network (coarse/fine) approach inspired by NeRF for handling varying image complexity
- **Adaptive Sampling**: Intelligent focus on high-detail regions while efficiently processing uniform areas

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **4x Super-Resolution**: Transform images from any resolution to 4x larger with preserved details
- **Content-Aware Processing**: Automatically identifies and prioritizes complex regions
- **Real-Time Optimization**: Efficient batch processing with GPU acceleration
- **Perceptual Quality**: GAN-based training ensures visually appealing results over pixel-perfect accuracy

### Technical Innovations
- **Dual-Network Architecture**: Coarse network for general upscaling, fine network for detail enhancement
- **Positional Encoding**: Advanced spatial awareness for better geometric reconstruction
- **Stratified Sampling**: Intelligent pixel sampling for computational efficiency
- **Residual Learning**: Skip connections and residual blocks for stable training

## Architecture

### Generator Network
```
Input (LR Image) → Conv2D → Residual Blocks → Upsampling → Conv2D → Output (HR Image)
                    ↓
              Skip Connections & Pixel Shuffling
```

**Key Components:**
- **Residual Blocks**: Conv2D → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU → Conv2D → Sum
- **Upsampling Layers**: Pixel shuffling for artifact-free upscaling
- **Skip Connections**: Preserve low-level features throughout the network

### Discriminator Network
```
Input (HR Image) → Feature Extraction → Classification → Real/Fake Score
                      ↓
                 Multiple Conv Blocks with Increasing Depth
```

### Content-Aware Processing Pipeline
1. **Image Analysis**: Identify regions of varying complexity
2. **Coarse Processing**: Generate initial super-resolution estimate
3. **Importance Sampling**: Weight regions based on detail requirements
4. **Fine Processing**: Enhance high-priority areas with detailed reconstruction
5. **Integration**: Combine coarse and fine outputs for final result

### Performance Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Content-aware processing reduces computational waste
- **Scalability**: Batch processing capabilities for large datasets
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various image types and domains
